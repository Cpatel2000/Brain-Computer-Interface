# Brain-Computer-Interface
With recent accomplishments in Brain-Computer Interface technologies and advancements in machine learning have resulted in the implementation of deep learning architectures, in terms of emotion classification using EEG signals. EEG signals are generated as a result of the user/individual various tasks such as mental, emotional, and physical which represent the brain functionality. Removing artifacts and extracting important features essential to analyze these signals becomes crucial. Utilizing Fast Fourier transform as a feature extraction technique proves to be a better feature extraction technique. In our project, we used the CNN-Convolutional Neural Network and LSTM-Long Short-Term Memory Architecture. We used 75-25 and 80-20 Train-Test splits where the best accuracy was obtained by LSTM.
